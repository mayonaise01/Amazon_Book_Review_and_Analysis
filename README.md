# Amazon_Book_Review_and_Analysis
This project is a Python-SQL integrated application that allows users to explore, review, and analyze books available on Amazon. The system connects a MySQL database with a Python interface using mysql-connector, allowing dynamic interaction with book review data via SQL queries executed within Python.

## üîß Project Features
## üîç Book Recommendation & Review
* Search books by title or author
* Submit your rating (1‚Äì5) and review comments
* Register automatically if you're a new user

## üìä Analytics & Reports
Get insights based on SQL queries directly from the database:
* Distribution of reviewer age and books by publish year
* Average ratings by book category
* Probability of authors receiving a review score > 4

## üß© Technical Highlights
* Python notebook (.ipynb) connected to MySQL via mysql-connector-python
* SQL queries embedded within Python functions (getDF() and editDF())
* Console-based interactive interface
* Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) with three main tables:
  * book_detail: Book metadata
  * book_rating: User reviews and scores
  * customer: Reviewer demographics

## üóÇÔ∏è Files Included
* Missing Data_python.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing all Python and SQL logic
* Missing Data_database.png: Database schema/ERD
* Missing Data_database.sql: SQL script for setting up the database and initial tables
